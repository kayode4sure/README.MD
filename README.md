# 🛍️ Retail Store Inventory Data Analysis (Excel-Based)

## 📌 Introduction
https://github.com/kayode4sure/README.MD/issues/3

In this project, I analyzed retail store inventory data to uncover patterns in product performance, stock efficiency, and supplier reliability. Using Excel and Power BI, I tracked key metrics such as:

- Inventory Turnover
- Stockout Rates
- Gross Margin Return on Inventory (GMROI)

The goal was to identify actionable insights that could:

- Reduce holding costs
- Improve replenishment cycles
- Boost overall profitability

The results led to clear recommendations for optimizing reorder points and adjusting product mix based on regional demand.

## ❓ Analysis Questions
This project explored the following business-critical questions:

- 💰 What are our total sales over the period?
- 📦 Which categories of items generated the most and least revenue?
- 🏬 Which store has the highest sales revenue?
- 🌍 Which regions are performing best?
- 📅 What days or months show the highest/lowest sales activity?
- 🌦️ What is the effect of weather conditions on our sales forecast?
- 🍂 How do seasonal trends affect our inventory levels?

## 🧮 Methodology
All analysis was performed using Excel and Power BI, without Python or external scripting. Key techniques included:

- Pivot tables for dynamic aggregation
- Conditional formatting for trend visualization
- Time-series charts for seasonal patterns
- DAX formulas in Power BI for advanced metrics
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
